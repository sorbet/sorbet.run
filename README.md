# sorbet.run



This is the repo that hosts https://sorbet.run. We commit and push the Sorbet
WASM payload to this repo on each master build of
https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet.

Basically the entire site is in `docs/`.

If you are at all interested in making sorbet.run better, please contribute!
We're happy to chat about potential improvements in the #internals on Slack (see
https://sorbet.org/en/community).
